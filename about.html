      <!-- About Me Summary -->
      <section class="about-summary">
        <p>Hi, I'm Kapu Karthik Chowdary, a passionate Front-End Developer with a love for creating dynamic, user-friendly websites. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and other cutting-edge web technologies. I am a passionate and dedicated software developer with hands-on experience in web and application development. My expertise spans across a variety of technologies, including JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Python. I have successfully worked on a wide range of projects, from building learning management systems and real-time chat applications to developing functional web apps with rich user interfaces and dynamic features.

            I am particularly adept at working with front-end technologies like React, ensuring smooth user experiences with responsive designs and efficient code. Additionally, I have a strong understanding of back-end development, demonstrated through my experience with Django and PostgreSQL, creating reliable and scalable solutions.
            
            As an advocate for clean and efficient coding practices, I strive to maintain high standards in my work while continuously learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the tech industry. I am always eager to tackle new challenges, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and contribute to innovative projects that drive business success.
            
            Currently, I am expanding my skill set with data science and full-stack development, with a keen interest in leveraging my skills to create impactful software solutions.</p>
